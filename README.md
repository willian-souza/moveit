# üìÑ About
The move.it consists of an application based on the Pomodoro Technique. This technique is a time management method that consists of using a stopwatch to divide the work/study into periods of 25 minutes, separated by brief intervals. Thus, in our application, every 25 minutes the user is given a challenge to execute.
- The challenge is drawn through a pre-defined list of exercises.
- This list contains stretching exercises and exercises for the eyes.
- Each challenge has an amount of XP that the user earns when completing the challenge, and the user will level up as he completes the challenges.
- The user only receives a challenge if he completes the 25 minutes of study/work (does not have the option to pause).That is, if he abandons the cycle, for whatever reason, before its end, the timer returns to the initial state.

This application was developed during the **Rocketseat Next Level Week 4**.

But i added some features:

- Responsiveness
